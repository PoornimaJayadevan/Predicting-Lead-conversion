# Predicting-Lead-conversion
A Logistic Regression model to predict lead conversion rates.
Developed a logistic regression model for lead conversion prediction using a dataset of approximately 9000 past leads.
Conducted data exploration, cleaning, and visualization to understand key attributes influencing lead conversion, including Lead Source, Total Time Spent on the Website, Total Visits, and Last Activity.
Utilized feature selection methods like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and manual selection to identify top predictors, and evaluated model accuracy using metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score.
